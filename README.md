# Under Water Vehicle 
Our team is developing an advanced underwater vehicle designed for operation inshallow water environments, with a depth range of 2-5 meters. The robot is equippedwith six thrusters, enabling maneuverability with 5 Degrees of Freedom (DOF).

### Primary Functions:
1. **Multidirectional Movement**: The robot can move in various directions:
○ Up and down (vertical movement)
○ Left and right (lateral movement)
○ Forward and backward (longitudinal movement)
○ Yaw (rotation around the vertical axis)
○ Roll (rotation around the longitudinal axis)
2. **Extended Underwater Operation**: The vehicle is capable of staying submergedfor more than 5 minutes, allowing for prolonged underwater tasks andexploration.
